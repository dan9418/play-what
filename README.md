# Play *What*?

[Play What](https://dan9418.github.io/play-what/) is a website for exploring and learning about music concepts, such as chords, scales, songs, and practice exercises. Every concept can be visualized in any key and on several instruments.

Under the hood, Play What is powered by an open source JavaScript library and data structure spec. The project is intended to be easily forked and extended by other web developers when complete.
